# zugbase architecture: the decided version

Design only, no code. Written 2026-10-04. It records the owner's decisions so far, in one place.

- **This document wins.** Where `docs/SHIDDUCH_LOGIC.md` or `docs/PEOPLE_AND_SOURCES.md` say
  something different, follow this one. Those two keep the research, the alternatives and the
  stress tests behind each decision.
- **Every name and number is made up.**
- **Not built yet.** A new clickable prototype comes first (section 13). The earlier prototype,
  `prototype/shidduch-flow.html`, is paused and out of date.

## 1. The architecture in one diagram

```
 People: one record per real person
   Guys · Girls · Shadchanim · References
   (parents and friends: kept, no list)
          ▲
          │ entries point to people
          │
 One ledger: every moment, written once
   calls, WhatsApp, profiles sent and
   received, notes, meetings, referrals,
   answers, dates, feedback
          │
          │ entries point to permanent IDs
          ▼
 Permanent IDs
   Sources: events, lists such as
     "Rivka's 10 shadchanim"
   Ideas: a suggested pair, not started
   Shidduchim: a real pair, with rounds
     and dates
   Open items: waiting on them, on me
          │
          │ everything else is worked out
          ▼
 Views, never copies
   Recent · Guys · Girls · Shadchanim ·
   Shidduchim · a person's page ·
   a shidduch page · a source page
          │
          │ chosen by
          ▼
 Mode (Single or Shadchan) and look
 (theme, density): what you see,
 never the data
```

**In plain words:**

- Each real person has **one record**.
- Everything that happens is written **once**, in the ledger.
- Sources, ideas, shidduchim, dates and open items each get a **permanent ID** that entries point
  to.
- Every screen is a **view** of that same information, never a copy.
- Mode and look change only **what you see**.

---

## 2. What is stored

| Stored | What it holds | Edited how |
|---|---|---|
| **Person** | one per real human. Every PeerMatch field, and the approved additions (age with its date, how well I know them, folders) | directly, like today |
| **Link** | a lasting fact between two people: mother of, contact for, reference for, shadchan for | directly |
| **Ledger entry** | one moment: when · from → to · channel · exact words · files · profile version · **about** (people, idea, shidduch, date, source) · **what it changes** | written by the app's flows; the received words are never changed |
| **Source** (ID) | an event, a group, a site, or a **list of shadchanim** ("Rivka's 10 shadchanim"): its name, who gave it, the entry it came in, its lines | named once; the lines are kept as they came |
| **Idea** (ID) | a suggested pair, not started yet: the two people (one may be me) and who suggested it | opened and closed by entries |
| **Shidduch** (ID) | a **real** Guy ↔ Girl pairing, one per pair forever, with each side's go-betweens | created by one tap (5.2) |
| **Round** (ID) | one attempt within a shidduch: Round 1, Round 2… | opened and ended by entries |
| **Date** (ID) | one meeting of the couple, within a round | its state comes from entries |
| **Open item** (ID) | something owed: **waiting on them**, or **waiting on me** | opened and closed by entries |
| **Profile version** | a frozen copy of a profile: text, files, language. It never holds the message it arrived in | made automatically when a profile changes or arrives |
| **File** | a photo, PDF or recording, stored once | never changed |
| **Folder** | an approved label on people | directly |
| **Settings** | the mode, backup information, and **presentation settings** (section 11) | in Settings; never part of records |

**Person types** are the categories the lists show: **Guy, Girl, Shadchan, Reference**.

- One person can have more than one type, for example a shadchan who is also my reference.
- Parents, siblings and friends are people too, each with one record. They have **no type of
  their own**: they appear through links ("Rachel, Leah's mother") and in search.
- **Me** is one record too, holding my profile versions.

---

## 3. What is worked out, never typed

- **For a person:**
  - how I know them: every meeting and referral, oldest first
  - last contact
  - what is waiting on them and on me
  - who has their profile, and which version
  - their ideas and shidduchim
  - whether they are relevant to me (5.4)
- **For an idea:** open, not applicable (by whom, why), or became a shidduch.
- **For a shidduch:**
  - its stage
  - my status and her status (or his and hers), each with who said it and when
  - who suggested it
  - its dates and both sides' feedback
  - what is waiting on them and on me
  - the next action
  - its rounds
- **For a source:** total, new, already here, contacted, replied, no reply, needs follow-up.
- **For Recent:** the ledger itself, newest first.

The results are saved as summaries, for speed. Whenever an entry changes, they are rebuilt from the
ledger. Nobody edits them by hand.

---

## 4. The rules

1. **Write once, show everywhere.** One entry shows on every page it concerns, and in Recent.
2. **Every status shows its source.** Tap "Her side: Yes" and you see Miriam's message.
3. **The original is never changed.** Words and files stay as they came. Only the app's reading
   of them (who it's from, what it's about, what it changed) can be fixed.
4. **The page you're on decides "about".** When the app can't tell, the entry waits in the Intake
   folder.
5. **One record per real person.** Every way a person can come in goes through **one matching
   check** (6.1).
6. **A shidduch exists only for a real Guy ↔ Girl pairing** (5.1).
7. **Permanent IDs** for sources, ideas, shidduchim, rounds, dates and open items. Entries always
   point to the ID, never "the latest one".
8. **A reply closes the exact item it answers.** The app names the item, and you confirm with
   Yes or No.
9. **A sent version is frozen.** Editing a profile makes a new version.
10. **No invented dates.** "Pasted Oct 4" until the real time is known. PeerMatch data with no
    date says "date unknown".
11. **Messages are built only from what you choose to send:** a profile version, chosen photos and
    files, and your own words. No History, note, reason or private answer can go out.
12. **Quiet.** Nothing nags: no reminder popups and no alarms. The lists simply show what is
    outstanding.
13. **Mode and look change the view, never the data** (sections 8 and 11).

---

## 5. Ideas and shidduchim

### 5.1 When a shidduch exists

**A shidduch record exists only when there is an actual Guy ↔ Girl pairing.** General work
never needs one. These **do not** create a shidduch:

- sending my profile to a shadchan
- calling a shadchan to introduce myself
- meeting a shadchan at an event
- receiving a girl's profile that I decide is not applicable
- calling a reference
- general talk with a shadchan

Each of those is an entry about the people involved, and nothing more.

### 5.2 The idea comes first

When someone suggests a pair, for example Miriam sends Leah's profile for me, the app records an
**idea**: Me ↔ Leah, suggested by Miriam, with a permanent ID.

- An idea is **not** a shidduch. It shows as one line on Leah's page, in Girls → For me, and in
  Shidduchim → Ideas:

  ```
  Idea for me · from Miriam, Aug 3
    [Not applicable]   [Interested]
  ```

- It opens a quiet item, **waiting on me: answer Miriam about Leah**.
- **Not applicable:**
  - the idea closes, with an optional reason (private)
  - no shidduch is created
  - the item stays open until you tell Miriam, or you choose "No reply needed"
- **Interested:**
  - the **shidduch is created**, and Round 1 starts from the idea
  - the app then proposes which earlier entries belong to it, each with Yes / No: the arrival of
    her profile, the opinion you asked Moshe for, the reference call
  - linking them changes only "about", never the entries themselves
- The same works for other people, in Shadchan Mode. "Rivka has a girl for Dovid: Noa" is an idea
  for Dovid ↔ Noa. **Make match** creates the shidduch directly, because it is my own decision to
  pair them.

### 5.3 Rounds

- There is **one permanent record per pair.**
- When the pair already has an ended shidduch and someone suggests it again, the suggestion shows
  **on that same record** as a new idea ("Suggested again by Chana").
- "Interested" opens **Round 2**. "Not applicable" opens nothing.

```
Me ↔ Leah
  Round 2 · 2028 · suggested by Chana
    active
  Round 1 · 2026 · 3 dates
    ended by her (hashkafa)
```

- Each round has its own stage, statuses, dates (numbered from 1) and open items.
- Earlier rounds stay visible below, clearly separated. Tap to fold them.

### 5.4 Relevance to me, worked out

| Leah's state | Worked out from | Single Mode | Shadchan Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Idea for me, undecided | an open idea Me ↔ Leah | Girls → For me | normal |
| Not applicable for me | the idea closed as not applicable | hidden from browsing; search finds her | normal |
| My active shidduch | Me ↔ Leah, current round active | Girls → For me, and Shidduchim | normal, with mine marked private |
| Ended (I said no, or she declined) | Me ↔ Leah, current round ended | Girls → Previous; search | normal |
| Never suggested to me | nothing involving me | not shown; search finds her | normal |

There is **no "relevance" field** to keep up to date. Leah's record, profile versions, files, how
she came to me and her History are **never removed or copied**, whatever the state.

### 5.5 She declined, and later David ↔ Leah

```
Me ↔ Leah · Round 1 · ended
  My side: Yes (Aug 9)
  Her side: No (via Miriam, Aug 16)
  Ended by her side · declined
```

Two years later, **David ↔ Leah** is a new pair, so it gets a **new shidduch record**, with its own
rounds, dates, open items and History.

**Why my private history can't leak:**

- **Rule 11:** a message is built only from what I choose: a profile version, chosen files, my
  words.
- **A profile version holds only her profile.** Miriam's wrapper ("an idea **for you**…") stays
  in the arrival entry.
- **The David ↔ Leah page shows only its own entries,** by its ID.
- **On Leah's page, my own shidduch is private and folded:** "My own shidduch with Leah (ended)".
  Nothing in it is ever offered for sending.
- **David ↔ Leah's go-betweens come from Leah's links** (her mother, her shadchan), never from my
  old shidduch.

---

## 6. People, sources and lists

### 6.1 One record per real person

The **matching check** has one owner in the code, and is used by every way in: adding by hand,
filing, lists, contact cards, chat import, the PeerMatch import.

| Signal | Result |
|---|---|
| Same WhatsApp number, phone or email | **"Miriam is likely already here"**, with her history. Same person: Yes is preselected, and one tap confirms. It never says "certain", because phones are shared (decided) |
| Same name (in any script, without titles) plus the same city or referrer | "Is this the Miriam you know?" Yes / No, nothing preselected |
| Similar name only | a new record, with a visible "maybe the same as…" hint |
| A name with no number | a light record marked "needs a number". It's checked again once a number is added |
| "Not the same person" | remembered, never asked again |

Duplicates can still be **merged**:

- Nothing is lost, and the old record becomes a pointer.
- Undo works.
- The merge is an entry in the ledger.

### 6.2 Meetings and referrals collect on the one record

- "Met at Event A", "met again at Event B", "recommended by Rivka", "on Sarah's list of 50",
  "recommended by Chana" are each **one change inside the entry where it happened**.
- They are **never a field**. Miriam's page shows them all under **How I know her**, oldest first.
- A meeting is a moment, so it's an entry. A link is only for lasting facts.

### 6.3 Lists of shadchanim are sources

- "Rivka's 10 shadchanim" is a **source with a permanent ID**, permanently under **Shadchanim →
  Sources**.
- Each line points to a **normal, permanent shadchan record** (new, or already here), or is
  "not added yet". **Never a copy.**
- **Progress is worked out from the ledger**, so contacting Miriam anywhere updates every list she
  is on: from her page, from Recent, from the WhatsApp flow.

```
‹ Rivka's 10 shadchanim
  from Rivka · Jun 8 · WhatsApp
  "Write to each one…"
 10 total · 6 contacted · 3 replied
 1 needs follow-up · 4 not contacted
──────────────────────────────────
 (the normal shadchan rows)
 [Send my profile to the 4 ›]
```

| Count | Worked out as |
|---|---|
| Total | the lines on the list |
| Contacted | anything I sent them, or a call, after the list arrived, from anywhere in the app |
| Replied | anything from them after my first contact |
| Needs follow-up | contacted, no reply, and the follow-up time has passed. **The default is 7 days after contact.** Each source or list can set its own date or number of days (decided) |
| Not contacted | on the list, nothing sent yet |

- A list's follow-up is **one quiet item**, not one reminder per person.
- **The ongoing relationship always lives on the normal shadchan record.** The list only shows
  where the group came from, and its progress.

---

## 7. Waiting on them, waiting on me

These replace the earlier words "Waiting" and "You owe":

- **Waiting on them:** I've done my part, and I'm waiting for them. Shown in **yellow** (the
  standing preference).
- **Waiting on me:** they've done their part, and I need to respond or do something. Shown in a
  **calm blue**, never red.

Each one is an **open item with a permanent ID**. These open by themselves, quietly:

| When this is recorded | It opens | It closes when |
|---|---|---|
| An idea for me arrives from X | waiting on me: answer X | I answer X, or choose "No reply needed" |
| I send X a profile and ask an opinion | waiting on them: X's opinion | X replies about it |
| I suggest a pair to X | waiting on them: X's side's answer | that answer comes in |
| X asks me for something (a photo, references, an answer) | waiting on me: that thing | I send it |
| A date happened | waiting on me: my feedback to the go-between; and waiting on them: the other side's feedback | each one comes in |
| My side decides, but I haven't told the go-between | waiting on me: tell them | I tell them |
| Call due (today, tomorrow, a date) | waiting on me: call X | a call to X |
| The **Waiting button** on a person (manual override) | waiting on them: what you type | the button, or their next message |
| A list's follow-up date | one item for the whole list | everyone on it has replied, or you close it |
| A pause or an ending | — | the shidduch's items close (with Undo) |

**Nothing ever tells you to chase a single.** Items point at go-betweens, or at your own answers.

---

## 8. Single Mode and Shadchan Mode

**One database and one ledger.** A mode is a setting. It changes which views each tab opens on,
and what comes first. **It never moves, hides for good, copies or changes data.**

| | Single Mode | Shadchan Mode |
|---|---|---|
| Focus | my shadchanim · profiles relevant to me · my active ideas · my shidduchim · Recent · waiting on them · waiting on me · calls due and next actions | all guys · all girls · all shadchanim · all shidduchim · all saved profiles · search, filters and matching tools |
| Recent | what concerns me and my network; other people's shidduchim show as one quiet line, "3 in Shadchan Mode" | everything |
| Guys | the guys I help, if any | all guys |
| Girls | **For me** (open ideas and my shidduchim) · Previous | all girls, including "not applicable for me" |
| Shadchanim | the same views; rows show "has my profile / old profile" | the same views |
| Shidduchim | mine: Active · Ideas · Ended | all, with mine marked private |
| Search | everyone, mine first | everyone |
| Make match | hidden | on the Shidduchim tab and on a single's page |

---

## 9. Navigation and screens

### 9.1 Bottom navigation: five tabs, in both modes

**Recent · Guys · Girls · Shadchanim · Shidduchim**

The tabs stay the same in both modes, so your hand always knows where things are. Only each tab's
default view changes (section 8).

### 9.2 Recent: a global, WhatsApp-like activity list

- Recent is **the ledger itself, newest first**: calls, WhatsApp, profiles sent and received,
  notes, dates, feedback, referrals, lists. **It is not a copy.** Full History stays on each
  person's page and each shidduch page.
- **The header has:**
  - Paste
  - search
  - the mode switch (Single · Shadchan)
  - Settings (gear)
  - the backup line
- **Its optional summary strip** (a presentation setting) shows: Waiting on them · Waiting on me ·
  Calls due · To file · My profile.
- **Days are grouped** ("Today", "Yesterday", "Sun Aug 23"). Each row:

```
Today
 (M)  Miriam → Me · WhatsApp     14:05
      "She's thinking about it…"
      Me ↔ Leah · Her feedback: Unsure
 (Mo) Me → Moshe · WhatsApp      09:30
      Leah's profile v1 · asked opinion
      Waiting on them: Moshe
Yesterday
 (R)  Rivka → Me · WhatsApp
      10 shadchanim · 7 new · 3 here
      Rivka's 10 shadchanim ›
```

- **Filter chips:** All · Calls · Messages · Profiles · Dates · Notes · To file.
- Tapping a row opens the entry. From there, one tap goes to the person, the shidduch, the date or
  the source it's about.

### 9.3 Guys and Girls

- **One or two lines per person**, with the approved zoom (Folders · Names · Details).
- **Views follow the mode** (section 8).
- **Shadchan Mode filters:** age, city, the quick-details checkboxes, and folders.
- Every row opens that person's one record.

### 9.4 Shadchanim

Views: **All · Waiting on them · Waiting on me · Needs contact · Sources**

```
Shadchanim · 112              − +
[ Search name, phone, city…     ]
 All · Waiting on them 6 ·
 Waiting on me 3 · Needs contact 18
 · Sources
──────────────────────────────────
 (M) Miriam · Jerusalem        3 d
     on them · on me · 2 active
     has v2 (old) · 5 sources
 (B) Batya · Beit Shemesh     2 mo
     no reply since Sep 2 · v3
 (D) Dina · Haifa              new
     never contacted · Rivka's 10
```

- **Needs contact:** never contacted, or a follow-up is due (decided). It does **not** include
  long silence.
- **Dormant (60+ days):** a separate, optional filter for anyone not contacted in 60 days or more.
  It's a filter only, never a reminder (decided).
- **References** are reached only from each single's page and from search. They have no tab or
  view (decided).
- **Sources:** every event, group, site and list. Each opens its source page (6.3).
- **Sort:** last contact, A–Z, recently added, waiting longest.
- **Group:** by who referred them, by folder, by city.

### 9.5 Shidduchim: a view made from shidduch and idea records

Views: **Active · Ideas · Ended**. It's never a folder of people.

### 9.6 The pages

**Person page** (guy, girl, reference): the PeerMatch-style page, with the details and contact
buttons in the standing order. At the top, one line each:

- ideas and shidduchim
- waiting on them, waiting on me
- how I know them

Then the profile, the files, the contacts and the full History. My own shidduch with this person
is folded and marked private.

**Shadchan page:** one line each, then the full History:

```
‹  (M) Miriam                  ב״ה
   Jerusalem · shadchan     [Edit]
 Call · Email · WhatsApp · SMS · Waiting
 Waiting on them  Leah's feedback,
                  Date 1 · 3 days
 Waiting on me    your parents' names
 My profile       has v2 (old) ·
                  [Send v3]
 Shidduchim       Me ↔ Leah · dating
 Last contact     call · Aug 21
 Call due         Today · Tomorrow
 How I know her   met Jan 12 · +4 ›
 History   All · Leah · mine
```

**Shidduch page:** the stage, my status, her status, waiting on them, waiting on me, next action,
a summary of the dates, and recent History. Behind tabs: **Dates · History (by round) · People**.

**Source page:** described in 6.3.

### 9.7 Where the earlier approved Home items went

| Approved earlier (`REBUILD_PLAN.md`) | Now |
|---|---|
| A Home tab | **Recent** is the first tab, and its optional summary strip holds the Home summaries |
| Calls due on Home, "Add someone to Calls due" | in **Waiting on me**, and in the summary strip; still set from any person |
| Memos | notes to myself: they show in Recent (Notes chip), and can be pinned to its top |
| Recently added | an "Added" chip in Recent |
| Last backup · Backup now | the backup line in Recent's header, and Settings |
| My profile, and who it was sent to | the summary strip in Single Mode; the Shadchanim rows show has / old / no profile |
| Settings on Home only | the gear in Recent's header |
| The Intake folder | "To file (2)" at the top of Recent, and Paste in its header; the folder itself stays |
| Different tabs per mode | the same five tabs; the mode changes the default views |
| Make match in the header (Shadchan Mode) | on the Shidduchim tab and on a single's page |
| Suggested to me (Yes / No) | an idea for me: open, not applicable, or interested |
| Ideas for me (folder) | Girls → For me, and Shidduchim → Ideas |
| Folders, zoom, Add to… | unchanged |

## 10. The look: Warm Modern Dashboard

**Approved by the owner**, from a ChatGPT mockup rendering ("Option 4 — Warm Modern Dashboard")
of the Shadchanim list and a shadchan page. The screenshot itself isn't stored in the repository.

**What the mockup shows, and what the builder follows:**

- **Background:** warm cream, with a soft peach glow behind the top of a person's page.
- **Cards and rows:**
  - near-white cards, about 16 px corners, a very soft shadow, no hard borders
  - the selected or first row has a light blue tint
- **Text:**
  - deep navy text, with warm grey for secondary lines
  - **serif** for the wordmark and screen titles ("Shadchanim")
  - clean **sans-serif** for everything else, with names in bold
- **Accent:** a calm blue for the active tab, the active view and links. The round "+" button is
  a soft blue-grey.
- **Avatars:** initials in soft pastel circles (blue, green, peach, lavender, sky). Never photos.
- **Icons:** simple line icons, each in a pale tinted circle or tile:
  - phone: green
  - message: blue
  - profile or document: peach
  - date: lavender
  - waiting (hourglass): amber
  - shidduchim (people): blue
- **List rows:**
  - avatar, name, "Last contact: today"
  - one status line, such as "1 waiting · 2 active"
  - a chevron at the end
- **Views:** a segmented control on a light grey track. The selected view is a white or
  light blue pill.
- **Search:** a rounded search field with a separate filter button (a sliders icon).
- **A person's page:**
  - a large avatar, the name, and a type chip ("Shadchan"), plus a "⋯" menu
  - **three summary tiles:** Last contact · Waiting on her · Active shidduchim
  - tabs: **Details · Conversation · Shidduchim · Files**
  - the Conversation is grouped by day, one row per moment: icon, title, short detail, time,
    chevron
- **Bottom navigation:** line icons with labels: Recent · Guys · Girls · Shadchanim ·
  Shidduchim. The active tab sits in a light blue rounded highlight.
- **ב״ה** sits small, at the top right of every screen.

**Kept from the owner's standing preferences, though the mockup doesn't show them:**

- **The contact buttons** sit under the summary tiles: Call · Email · WhatsApp · SMS · Waiting, in
  that order, compact.
- **Waiting on them is yellow or amber. Waiting on me is calm blue.**
- **Yes / No buttons,** never ✕.
- **No uppercase section labels,** and no big bulky buttons.
- **A girl's photo appears only when tapped,** and the prototype uses a silhouette instead of a
  photo.

**Where it differs from the decided structure:**

- The mockup's Shadchanim views (All · Active · Recently Active · A–Z) are replaced by the decided
  views: All · Waiting on them · Waiting on me · Needs contact · Sources. Active, recently active
  and A–Z become sort options.
- The mockup's single "Waiting on her" tile shows both counts here: on her, and on me.

**Fonts:** no font is loaded from other sites, so it works offline and behind NetSpark.

- The serif comes from the phone's own fonts (Noto Serif on Android).
- The sans-serif is the phone's system font.

## 11. Presentation settings, kept apart from the data

Planned for later. **These are presentation only.**

| Setting | Options |
|---|---|
| Theme | Warm (default) · Blue · Sage · Dark |
| Density | Comfortable · Compact |
| Icon and avatar size | Large · Medium · Small |
| Dashboard layout (Recent) | Recent-first · Summary-first · Minimal |
| Summary cards | show · hide |

- There is **no "Calming Mode".**
- These settings are stored with the other settings, **never in people, entries or IDs**.
- Changing one **never writes a ledger entry** and never changes a count, a status or a rule.
- Every screen takes its colors, sizes and spacing from **design tokens**, so a theme or density is
  just a different set of tokens.
- The data architecture never depends on the look.

---

## 12. How this reconciles the five earlier attempts

| Attempt | Kept | Replaced |
|---|---|---|
| **PeerMatch** | every field and flow · the person-page details · contact order · the after-call popup · one message per profile, PDF first, photo Yes / No · the WhatsApp import · ZIP and TXT backups · the referral tree (now worked out from sources) | copied History → one ledger · one Waiting switch per person → open items · `referredBy` → sources · Make match's three copies → a shidduch |
| **zugmatch** | one owner per feature · one WhatsApp queue · backup round-trip tests | its PeerMatch data model |
| **ZivugBase** | the engine: Dexie tables, one entry linked to many records, phone keys, soft delete, the PeerMatch import, the Intake folder keeping the original | status fields typed next to History · the rejected Ideas and "Where they came from" sections (now one line each) |
| **zugbase, earlier builds** | the Intake folder · folders as labels · zoom · Calls due on anyone | folders-first navigation · History inside each person |

## 13. The first clickable prototype

### 13.1 The exact screens

All with made-up data, initials as avatars, the Warm Modern Dashboard look, and no external
loads.

**The five tabs:**

1. **Recent**: header (Paste, search, mode switch, gear) · optional summary strip · day-grouped
   rows · filter chips.
2. **Girls**:
   - Single Mode: For me · Previous
   - Shadchan Mode: All, with age and city filters
3. **Guys**: All, used for David in Shadchan Mode.
4. **Shadchanim**: All · Waiting on them · Waiting on me · Needs contact · Sources, at Names and
   Details zoom, with 100+ made-up rows.
5. **Shidduchim**: Active · Ideas · Ended.

**The pages:**

6. **Girl page: Leah.** Her idea line, profile, files, how she came to me, History, with my own
   shidduch folded.
7. **Shadchan page: Miriam.** Waiting on them and on me, my profile version, shidduchim, How I
   know her, History.
8. **Source page: "Rivka's 10 shadchanim".**
9. **Shidduch page: Me ↔ Leah.** Overview, then Dates, History and People.

**The sheets:**

10. **File from Intake**, with the matching check ("Miriam is already here…") and "Idea for me ·
    About a shidduch · A shadchan · A list of shadchanim · Just a note".
11. **The idea answer:** Not applicable · Interested, then the proposal to link earlier entries.
12. **Send:** a profile, a version, and "ask opinion / suggest / just send", with a preview of
    exactly what goes out.
13. **After a call.**
14. **Dates:** set up · move · did it happen? · feedback.
15. **Make match: David ↔ Leah.**

### 13.2 What it must prove before production coding starts

- [ ] **Recent reads like WhatsApp.** Every row opens the right person, shidduch, date or source.
      Deleting an entry removes it everywhere at once, which proves Recent is a view and not a
      copy.
- [ ] **One Miriam.** Adding her from an event, a list and a referral never makes a second
      record, and "already here" shows her history.
- [ ] **"Rivka's 10" updates by itself.** Contacting Miriam from her page or from Recent changes
      the list's counts, with no action on the list.
- [ ] **Waiting on them and waiting on me** show the right items. Each reply closes only the item
      it answers. For example, Miriam's "she's thinking" leaves the wait open.
- [ ] **No shidduch without a pairing.** Sending my profile, introducing myself, meeting at an
      event, calling a reference, and a "not applicable" profile create no shidduch.
- [ ] **An idea becomes a shidduch.** "Interested" creates Me ↔ Leah, and the earlier entries are
      linked with Yes / No.
- [ ] **One date ID.** Date 1 set, moved, happened, and both sides' feedback all point to the
      same date.
- [ ] **Not applicable:**
  - Leah disappears from Single Mode browsing
  - search finds her
  - she's normal in Shadchan Mode
  - nothing about her is lost
- [ ] **Declined, then David ↔ Leah:**
  - the new shidduch starts empty
  - the send preview contains only her profile version
  - nothing from Me ↔ Leah appears on it
- [ ] **Round 2** opens on the same Me ↔ Leah record, and Round 1 stays visible below it.
- [ ] **Modes change views only.** Switching modes changes no counts behind the scenes.
- [ ] **Look and density change the look only.** A quick theme and density toggle changes no data.
- [ ] **It feels simple:**
  - 112 shadchanim are scannable, with no big cards
  - one hand is enough
  - the main flows take few taps
  - the screens feel calm, not stressful
- [ ] **It works offline,** with made-up data only, and no photographs.

## 14. Conflicts, and open questions

**Conflicts found, and how they're settled**

1. **The new five tabs replace the approved tab sets and Home items** (`REBUILD_PLAN.md`: Home ·
   Shadchanim in Single Mode, and Home with Calls due, Memos, Recently added, backup, My profile,
   Settings on Home only). Settled in 9.7, so every approved item still has a home. Confirmed by
   the owner.
2. **"A shidduch only for a real pairing" changes my earlier design**, where a profile arriving for
   me created Me ↔ Leah. Settled: the **idea** comes first (5.2). `SHIDDUCH_LOGIC.md` and
   `PEOPLE_AND_SOURCES.md` now say so.
3. **"Reopen as Round 2"** (decided earlier) and "a shidduch only for a real pairing" (decided now)
   fit together if a repeat suggestion first shows as an idea on the same record, and "Interested"
   opens Round 2 (5.3). Confirmed by the owner.
4. **"Waiting" and "You owe" are renamed** "Waiting on them" and "Waiting on me". The PeerMatch
   button "Waiting for reply" becomes the manual "Waiting" override, still yellow.
5. **References are a main type but have no tab.** They're reached from each single's page and
   from search. The owner answered: singles' pages and search only, for now.
6. **Parents and friends no longer have a list.** ZivugBase's roles (contact, friend, helper) and
   the prototype's "Friends and others" group are dropped. The records stay, reached through links
   and search.
7. **The rejected "Ideas", "Where they came from" and "Profile shared" sections** (ZivugBase) are
   now one line each, plus views (Girls → For me, Shidduchim → Ideas, How I know her). None is a
   section.
8. **The Warm Modern Dashboard has no file in any repository.** It's recorded in section 10 from
   the owner's screenshot; this file is now its home.

**Answered by the owner (2026-10-04)**

1. **Matching:** approved. Same phone or email shows "**likely** already here", with one tap to
   confirm. Same name only: the app asks.
2. **Needs contact** doesn't include long silence. A separate, optional **Dormant (60+ days)**
   filter does.
3. **References** stay on singles' pages and in search, for now.
4. **List follow-up:** 7 days after contact by default. Each source or list can set its own date
   or number of days.
5. **The Warm Modern Dashboard** screenshot was received, and is described in section 10.

**Confirmed:**

- **Home is replaced by Recent**, as in 9.7.
- **The idea comes before the shidduch**, as in 5.2.
- **A repeat suggestion uses Round 2** on the same pair record, as in 5.3.

**Still open**

- **The app's name.** The mockup's wordmark says "ZivugMatch"; the project and the earlier
  screens say "zugbase". Which name should the prototype show? It uses "zugbase" until you say.
